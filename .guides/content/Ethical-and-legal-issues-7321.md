All computer scientists and users must behave in a legal way and relevant legislation is considered later.

Computer scientists and users should also behave ethically. That means that they should act morally in ways that individuals and societies think of as reflecting good values.
Usually behaving legally and ethically mean the same things but occasionally there can be conflicts of interest.

Ethics describe guidelines that users should follow and organisations such as the Computer Ethics Institute publish these ethical guidelines e.g. using a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for fellow humans, not using a computer to harm others and never claiming a level of competence that they do not possess.
Laws do not describe guidelines that users **should** follow but ones that they **must** follow or be prosecuted for committing a crime.
Ethical values can be applied anywhere in the world but laws vary from country to country.

Ethical considerations could include developing systems that can be used to harm or kill others e.g. developing guidance systems for drones and missiles. It is perfectly legal for a computer scientist to work on these for a government department but some may consider it unethical to do so as their work can be used to harm others.
