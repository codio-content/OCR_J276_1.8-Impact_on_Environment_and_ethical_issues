The impact of digital technology on the environment has been both positive and negative.

### Negative effects – Energy consumption

- All electronic equipment consumes electricity when it is working and also in its production and when it is recycled.
- As more people are using computers, tablets and smartphones then more electricity is required and electricity production has harmful effects on the environment.
- Social networking makes the problem worse as all those uploaded files have to be stored somewhere. They are stored on servers in huge data centres – in 2011 it was calculated that there were half a million worldwide.
These consume vast amounts of electricity for the running of the stacks of servers and more importantly for cooling them down.
It has been estimated that by 2030, 40% of the world’s energy consumption will be due to the use of digital devices.

### Negative effects – E-waste

- ‘E-waste’ is any waste created by electronic devices that have been thrown away, as well as waste substances created in the manufacture and use of electronic devices.
- Often they are dumped in landfill sites where toxic substances such as lead, mercury and cobalt can get into the soil and the water supply from the landfills and therefore cause health problems.
- Many companies illegally send this e-waste to third world countries. Ghana in Africa has become a huge dumping ground for e-waste from developed countries.
- There are laws requiring everyone to dispose of used equipment safely so that it can be recycled. It is also an ethical responsibility to fellow citizens and the environment.
- Another ethical solution is to donate the equipment to charities who distribute it to people who need it but cannot afford to buy it.
