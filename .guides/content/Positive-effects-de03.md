Computer science has also had a positive effect on the environment, the natural world and our battle to reverse climate change.

- Digital devices are used to monitor climate change by collecting information, transmitting the data around the world, analysing it and allowing scientists to collaborate.
Computers use the data to build complex models which are used to understand the factors affecting climate change and make predictions for the future. The models can be used to test new solutions without having to further endanger the environment.

- Computer software is used to design efficient devices to produce electricity from natural resources such as wind and wave power. The designs can then be tested using computer models without having to first build the models and then modify them in the light of the results. Computer software is also involved in their production and installation.

- Tracking devices using GPS can be used to monitor all animals and especially endangered species to learn more about their habits such as migration routes. The results are analysed by computer and complex models can be built to help improve conservation strategies.
